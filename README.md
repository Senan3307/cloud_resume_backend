# Purpose of the Backend Repository:

- Handle Business Logic: The backend processes incoming requests (such as submitting a resume or interacting with a contact form) and implements business logic for the application.
- Database Interaction: It communicates with databases to store user data, resume information, or logs.
- Authentication: It might include features for authenticating users and managing sessions or tokens for secure interactions.
- Cloud Services Integration: Interacts with cloud services such as AWS, GCP, or Azure, for tasks like uploading files to S3 (or similar), running serverless functions (like AWS Lambda), or managing databases (like AWS DynamoDB).
- Scalability and Maintenance: The backend is designed to scale to accommodate more traffic, especially since the resume application might gain significant use. It also includes monitoring and logging for maintenance and troubleshooting.

# Key Files and Directories:

## tests/
- Contains unit and integration tests for the backend. Testing is critical to ensure that the backend behaves as expected and is able to scale properly under different conditions. The tests might include API tests, database interaction tests, and mock services.

## lambda_function.py
- If using serverless architecture (e.g., AWS Lambda), this directory contains the functions that execute based on cloud events

## .gitignore
- tells Git which files or directories to ignore when committing changes to a repository. It helps prevent unnecessary or sensitive files from being tracked in version control.
